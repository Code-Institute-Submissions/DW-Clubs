## Testing:
___
It's very important to validate a project so that the site is responsive and really attractive to the user
And i have also tried to check the spelling to see wheather wjhat i wrote make sense. 
But i have also validated the code with __W3Schools CSS and HTML__ validator.



### Responsiveness
* __Implementation__ In this project i have used bootstrap to ensure maxmum  __Responsiveness__.
* __Responsiveness__ was as to be expected, except for the navbar, which did so collapse on click by following the teaching and reapeating them to get sure how to apply the JavaScript links which helps the toggle and the dropdwn lists. I felt good that it worked.

### Design

* __Implementation__ The design of the project was just thought of and trying to impliment it in a real world,
was just trying to look on different kind of gym site and picking some different kind of pictures, but i had just used olny the pictures not less than that.
The project has got three parts but they are laid on one single page.
* __Results__  The font Lora brought out the lay out in a perfect way matching with the blue color and white for the navbar and the footer. At 
first i had made my navbar and footer with a background image blueblack gradient but later i changed to dark blue which is really good for the project.

### Header & Navbar:
* Plan: The header consis of a __navbar__ and is responsive.

* __Implementation__: I used  the different sections of the HTML page. The navbar is a Boostrap navbar. It will collapse the navlinks into an icon at smaller screensizes. I customized this for my likings ie my logo and other links on the navbar.
* __Test__: I test the responsivness of the header by opening the website in chrome and then resizing the window. I Also doublecheck in the chrome dev-tools, sometimes these two differs, the more correct one is the dev-tools one. I also doublechecked and looked at my website through my phone. I test to see if my navlinks works by clicking them. I use the dev-tools to see if my navlinks collapse into my chosen icon properly.
* __Results:__ The header work as intended. It is fully responsive on all screensizes. The navbar looks correct and the navlinks properly links to the different HTML-section linked. The navlinks correctly collapse into an icon at smaller sizes.
* __Verdict:__ The worked as i wanted and it has passed the test.

### Carousel Section:
* __Plan:__ **Use** some kind of slides images to represent different kind  of the gyms to go to. I made three different slide images with caption in the middle of each image. It should be fully responsive and attractive.
* **Implementation:** I used google to search for different kind of images to use . and with this i used bootstrap for my Carousel image making them to fit the whole screen with the help of some css to look responsive.
* __Results:__ My Carousel images worked well just as i like  maybe because i just copied the whole code as it was in bootstrap.
* __Verdict:__ The Carousel images passed all the test.

### Photos And Texts About The Site:
* **Plan:** I added a container-fluid in a navbar with Carousel image in the middle i had to put a Carousel caption with words about the gym. in pictures there
are people working out or something about the gym. And everything am gonna do will be about the gym.
* **Implementation:** I created a div container and within a div container i had create another div class carouselindicators within div carouselindicators i created 
a div class carousel-inner so i had to fix the three images within the carousel-inner to try make them my slide images.
The images i have used have found them on google just through searching for the better ones .
* **Test:** To see if everything works as intended I always use the chrome dev-tools to see what it would look like on different screen sizes.
* **Results:** Everything looks fine and works well as expected.
* __Verdict:__ The images & text about the project passed all the tests. 

### The Main Page:
* __Plan:__ To this main page i made it that it is clear for a viewer to easily acess the button for joining the club and some paragraphs which are meaningful about the site.
* __Implementation:__ I created a div section container and within the div i created more other four divs each giving it a photo and a paragraph of one word each, but all the images are about gym activities. 
In the styling of this i used bootstrap to design it out.
* __Test__ I had no issues with this section when i was testing it and i have also tried it with w3school validate and it passed it.
* __Results__ Everything worked well .
* __Verdict__ The images are working well as i wanted when i hover over mouse they zoom out and mouse out they zoom in.
